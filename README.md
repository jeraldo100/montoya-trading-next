## Website Features

I was only asked to make a static website not a full on e-commerce website. It should also come with an email service for requests and an Content Management System.

It should only view the landing page, products page giving information for the products and its specifications, basic information of the company, and a contacts page that also has email requests.

A relatively simple website for my first project after graduating

## Tech Stack

-Next.js (https://nextjs.org/)

-Vercel  (https://vercel.com/)

-Sanity.io (https://www.sanity.io/)

-Resend --to be added (https://resend.com/)

I first tackled this project using React.js but then moved it into Next.js for better page routing and SEO Optimization and because it just pairs well with Vercel.

Vercel because its cheap and comes with edge functions.

I decided it would be best to use Sanity.io for a headless CMS for the company to use and update its content remotely.

Resend because its recommended by Vercel as an API for emails.
